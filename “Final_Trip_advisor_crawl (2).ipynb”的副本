The train was very comfortable. It was a 400 meter walk from the station to the beach, but unfortunately heavy rain made the going a bit of a challenge. I was trying to keep my new camera from getting wet, as well as an umbrella trying its hardest not to turn inside out in the strong winds. However, the heavy rain kept the Instagram crowd away so I could get some photos. The theme this year was the Lost City of Atlantis and the sculptors from many countries captured the spirit. They were very talented and amazingly the sculptures remained intact despite the rain. I would like to return another year, but the weather is so unpredictable in Taiwan that it is hard to know when the sun will shine.

Oh, don't worry about the sand sticking to your shoes. We were worried at first that we might not be able to walk on the beach when it's raining. There's a plank walkway nicely paved for you to walk on around all the sculptures. So you are not going to land on any sandy ground, follow the walkway and you will be just fine and remember to check out all the sand art sculptures.We too were worried for the sculptures for they might collapse in the heavy rain, but they stayed strong and stood in the rain, held their shapes well and it was amazing to see such great work done by sculptors from around the world.\n","  review_date : June 3, 2018\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : This art festival is super cool, and not like anything I’ve seen before (not in person anyway).

It is a very busy popular beach.The sand sculptures are very well done and maintained. To get on the beach though you had to pay $100 Taiwan eachAbout $4 Australian. Although the water looked fine life guards wouldn't allow anyone in deeper than their ankles.I recommend doing the other activities Fulong has to offer as apart from the sculptures the beach was a waste of time.\n","  review_date : June 23, 2016\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : We happened to be in Fulong for a music performance but had some spare time so we checked out the sculptures.At $100 I initially was reluctant but, seeing as we were already there, forked out the dosh. And I wasn't disappointed.There were three sections: international artists, local professional and local contest.

This is a beautiful beach. Got the train from Taipei, took about 1hr 20 mins, The beach is very convenient to the station. The rainbow bridge across to the sand is a beautiful arch and the golden sand is clean. When I visited in June, the water was lovely and warm too. Lifeguards also keep an eye on you.The sculptures from international artists have various themes, and are amazingly finely wrought.

We had no choice but to fight against the wind and rain and finally got our feet on the beach. It was empty, no one was there for obvious reason, heavy rain.

We explored the whole festival and were drenched, but we still enjoyed ourselves. It would be better if it was sunny, but then again it might be crowded and you will be sweating. Oh, don't worry about the sand sticking to your shoes. We were worried at first that we might not be able to walk on the beach when it's raining. There's a plank walkway nicely paved for you to walk on around all the sculptures. So you are not going to land on any sandy ground, follow the walkway and you will be just fine and remember to check out all the sand art sculptures.We too were worried for the sculptures for they might collapse in the heavy rain, but they stayed strong and stood in the rain, held their shapes well and it was amazing to see such great work done by sculptors from around the world.\n","  review_date : June 3, 2018\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : This art festival is super cool, and not like anything I’ve seen before (not in person anyway).

You can also do a little bit of cycling at the Fulong. I also recommend to ride around the cape trail (around 15-20K) Although most of the people only ride through the tunnel and stop at the end of the tunnel. It is worth it.

Grounds are lovely but way too busy the public can use the pools free of charge.. So why do hotel guests have to pay a resort fee if anyone can use the pools? On top of the absorbent amount that you already pay for your room. Next time I’ll stay somewhere else and just walk over into your grounds and use your pools will save me lots of money. The room was musty smelling and so was the whole floor to be honest. Yep nice view if you like all the buildings in front of you ‘ocean view but not worth the rude staff we encountered. (Granted there was 1 or 2 of nice front desk & restaurant staff) Room was old. Couch had a disgusting stain on it. Pillows were horrible. We also had forgotten our key one day & went down to the reception at our tower but they said no you have to walk over to reception- which was quite a hike. I then wait in line for 20 minutes to be told that I could have rung maintenance from the phone on our floor… ARE YOU JOKING! Why couldn’t the reception in our tower tell us that. Biggest rip off. Will definitely be returning to the Sheraton next time we are in Hawaii.Had notified hotel that would be arriving at 7.30am but when we arrived at 9.30am room wasn’t ready until 3pm. Then they tried to say they can get us another room for $75USD JUST TO GET IN EARLY!!! The room was already cleaned and it didn’t have a partial ocean view room like we had booked and it had 2 beds instead of 1 that we requested (& WE WERE ON OUR HONEYMOON!!!).... why would I pay $75 extra for something I don’t even want. So we waited. I completely understand having a check in time but if you are offering me a room that’s ready and not what I had booked then you can at least let me in free of charge. They also asked for a $630USD deposit which was fine even though our total resort fees were $280. This I had no issue with. My issue is when I start being charged $19.60, $59 over my stay and then a whopping $187 (on our checkout day). When I asked the reception they said they were deposits & would be released to me... but you’ve already taken sooo much as a deposit... why would you need those extra deposits. Very rude and uncalled for. On the bright side the Italian restaurant is fantastic & so is the ice cream shop!\n","  review_date : June 5, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : The Hilton Hawaiian Village hasn't lost any of its charm. It's a beautiful oasis in the middle of paradise, if you believe it. It's not perfect, but its flaws are easily overlooked because of the natural beauty and relaxation you can find there.They don't play by the usual Hilton rules, so even at the highest HHonors level, you'll see no room upgrades, no late checkout, nor will you be entitled to the free breakfast that you get at all other Hilton properties (they give you a daily $10 credit instead - which is total b.s.).Prices are on par with the rest of Waikiki, and the property offers many things to do. The staff is fairly friendly and helpful, but you should check your bill on the way out because they sometimes add charges that don't apply to you. For me, it was a daily $59 valet parking charge, even though we didn't have a car. The desk clerk easily removed the charge and was apologetic, but I somehow think this is a calculated semi-scam on Hilton's part. Overall, beautiful property, pretty good staff, some slipshod practices, LONG lines at the Starbucks every morning, and a painfully slow check-in process. With all that, I'll be back because the positives outweighed the negatives.\n","  review_date : May 7, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : First impression was that it is a very busy area! It really is a village, more for families with kids. There seemed to be a lack of music throughout the complex. There are definitely a lot of shops for everyones fix. The beach was close and the water was perfect! The only thing I did not like was the fact hotel guest have to pay for an umbrella and each chair, average $60+ a day (until 5pm), the resort fee does not cover this, resort charge $40, excise tax $9.26, room tax $20.13, (per day). The wifi was so bad I had to keep it off. I know it's Hawaii so I guess expect to pay for everything! Smaller island next time.\n","  review_date : June 5, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : We are currently staying at the Ali’i tower in a corner king room. The room is spacious and the view is great. However, this resort is like being at Universal Studios in Orlando in the summer. It is completely overcrowded, understaffed, and lacking in customer service. Check in was a zoo despite our Hilton Honors status and having completed online checkin. Lines are long and poorly organized, turning into a free for all as people cut, go to wrong lines, and staff doesn’t care or direct traffic. The drop off/valet is constantly clogged with so many cars, it takes forever just to pull around to the valet desk. Again, not enough staff keeping at least one of the 3 lanes open so returning guests can get to the valet desk without waiting for every taxi and van to unload new arrivals and all their luggage. Incredibly long lines for any restaurant, Starbucks, etc. Very limited room service menu with high surcharges clearly designed to discourage room service use; room service offerings come from a snack bar, are of mediocre quality, and you cannot order breakfast the night prior, so you are stuck with long lines every morning just to eat or get coffee. There are a few family activities, but not as many as I expected for a “family” resort (movies on Wednesday and Saturday, lei making classes, and a kids club). When needing to replace a DVD rental card so my child could participate in the lei making class, I was directed by the concierge to the massive mail/key line. Despite leaving 30 min early for the class, I barely made it in time due to the wait and, again, the huge number of people cutting in line that staff did nothing about, even after the woman in front of me complained and staff acknowledged it was happening. I waited 15-20 min for someone to spend 30 seconds handing me a card. I just came back from the Ritz in London, spent a similar amount per night on my room there, and the service difference is laughable. For upgraded prices and “amenities” in the Ali’i tower, I would also expect the Ali’i tower staff and concierge to perform some of these tasks such as replacing a card. Also, there is ongoing construction next door with loud machinery daily.\n","  review_date : June 5, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Love the idea of being in one part of the island and walking around to great places to eat and spend time with the family.

After a lengthy discussion with a very helpful staff member we were eventually offered the room as originally booked provided we stay one night in the lower level room.The room finally provided whilst having a great view was in need of renovation, the bed was comfortable and the room clean. The resort itself was very crowded particularly the pools .There are a number of restaurants if you had no need to to venture outside the complex but would suggest taking advantage of the local bus service or walk along the boardwalk to Waikiki as there are a number of excellent restaurants close by.Would we stay there again, probably not.\n","  review_date : June 3, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Came with the family.

However, our experience was the exact opposite. Our original room was filthy. It looked like it had not been properly cleaned in months. Our bed sheets were stained, the sinks and the tub had visible grime, the tile floors had hair, dust and crumbs on it. The list goes on. I was uncomfortable staying there so they gave us another room. Our new room was better, but still dirty and unacceptable in my opinion. There was a lot hair on my bathroom floor. Like a woman had emptied her hairbrush on the ground. There was also urine at the base of the toilet, that remained there during our entire stay! The inside of the bathroom drawer was stained plywood, no liner. The back of the bathroom door had a hole and screw exposed. The tv remote was sticky and dirty, there was discolored spots on bathroom door, mascara spots on the mirror, the tv was dusty. And the list goes on. I did not get a pleasant response from customer service. They seemed irritated and too busy to bother with me. So I bought Lysol disinfecting wipes and spray and did some light cleaning. I used towels to cover the bathroom floor everyday so my feet were not touching that nasty bathroom floor. The common areas in my building (Tapa) also need repairs and a thorough cleaning. The carpets appeared dirty with visible dirt and debris. There was a white blanket of dust on the wood floors, especially near and under the furniture and around the baseboards. It had obviously not been vacuumed, swept or mopped in a very long time. There were places where wallpaper was peeling away from the wall, the ice machine was broken, etc. That building. The entire Tapa building needs a complete overhaul. I don't need my hotel rooms to be brand new, but I do expect them to be clean! Customer service was not great either. Needless to say, I will not be staying at a Hilton ever again!\n","  review_date : June 2, 2019\n","\n","[parse_reviews] url: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii-or10.html?filterLang=en\n","[get_reviews_ids] data-reviewid: ['678392959', '678257274', '678212999', '678178575', '678159523']\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Clean as looks just like photos.

As I had days before proposed to my partner I thought it appropriate to upgrade to a better hotel and enjoy our last 6 days in Hawaii. I found a great deal on Expedia and found ourselves on our way to the rainbow tower at the Hilton Hawaiian village. Check in although can have long queues we were greeted by a wonderful desk clerk who expedited our check in and gave us a great explanation of the surrounding areas. Our baggage was attended by bell hops and yes they still call them bellhops. We took in the views of wildlife as well as gardens and the surrounding waterfalls as we made our way to our room. And what a room ocean front 17th floor! WOW. the staff brought our bags after a brief conversation and were there in no time. They are efficient and extremely pleasant they can’t do enough for you, and that is reflected in the tip. Over all we felt relaxed as soon as we entered the hotel and our posture and stress levels certainly dropped after being in town and experienced crowds, homelessness, and noise from sirens every night.

Check in was slow and seemed to be understaffed. Was informed that the hotel did not have adjoining rooms, not that they weren't available, but they did not have adjoining rooms. I questioned this but was repeatedly given the same story. So, we ended up with 2 rooms on the same floor. Check in experience was not great. We were not given a map of the property and were given verbal instructions how to find our room. The property has multiple towers and we initially ended up in the wrong tower. Staff in that tower provided clear direction to the correct tower. Definitely room for improvement in this process.When we entered the first room, the first thing we saw was a door to an adjoining room, which we were told didn't exist. Obviously, we were not pleased.Both rooms were nice but nothing special. In our opinion and based on our sore backs, the beds are way too soft. The property is beautiful and with the exception of pigeon control, was well maintained. The pool area don't provide much shade for those of us that can't stay in direct sun the entire day. The surrounding buildings provide shade at various times of the day based on the path of the sun. Umbrellas were not available. Umbrella's and chairs were available for rent at the beach. Beach is very nice. Pigeons are an issue anytime food is present around the pool and sometimes when there isn't food. Pigeons are also a problem in the Tropics Bar and Grill which is beach side. Netting is in place around the perimeter but the doors are left open. Pigeons landed on tables, chairs, etc. Pigeons droppings were noted in multiple locations. We experienced multiple aggressive pigeons when trying to eat. Aren't Pigeon droppings known to carry Salmonela?Another issue in Tropics was a family letting a child (approximately 18 months) run around in the restaurant without pants, diaper, etc. Then the couple had him sitting on the chairs, table, etc. without pants, diaper, etc. Didn't really need to see this while dining. Glad we weren't the next customers at that table. Waitress saw it but nothing was done. Inquired about late check in because our flight was at 9:00 pm. Told it was not available without additional charges. I agreed to pay the $150 for one room then was told she would have to talk with her Supervisor because it may not be available. Then why did you offer it? Supervisor called me about 3 hours later to let me know they would accommodate the late check outOverall, it's a nice property but management needs to improve the overall operation of the facility, including check in experience, take better care of Hilton Honors members, deal with the pigeon issue, training of staff, etc.\n","  review_date : June 1, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : I just loved my trip from beginning to end.

It’s close to a number of decent restaurants (we didn’t eat onsite at all), and views of the beach and Diamond Head are astounding. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower with a beachfront view. We were hoping for a Diamond Head view from our room, but ended up with a corner room that looked onto the ocean and lagoon. Turned out to be a pretty decent view (we were on an upper floor) and the room was nice and large, with two lanais. Room quality is typical of a Hilton, as are staff and services offered. There are lots of pools, and none of them seemed overcrowded while we were there. The lagoon is a nice option for families with small children, but we preferred the ocean side with the break wall. All things considered (price, location, quality, services), we’d probably look to Hilton Hawaiian Village as our first choice for a future visit to Waikiki!\n","  review_date : June 1, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : We used our points for an ocean front room in the Rainbow tower. Best vacation idea in a very long time. We could sit on the lanai and see the sea turtles swimming around while people swam by them unaware. We did the same thing later snorkeling. It’s hard to see them unless they poke their heads up next to you. It was easy to rent umbrellas and chairs, floaties and more. The Hilton is a huge property with its own village. When our luggage took a side trip, we loved the easy access to ABC stores. You can get just about anything there. The ice cream shop on site is wonderful but often has long lines. Timing is everything. We ate at CJ’s for breakfast and dinner. It’s not a hotel restaurant but in the village. Delicious. You could stay on the property and never leave. You could but you should not:) It’s within walking distance of all the shops and restaurants. We even walked to the Ala Moana mall, but there is a bus stop right there at the hotel that will get you there quick. There is a car rental place across the street. As for the room, it was nice. We had two double beds so ordered a roll alway too so everyone wouldn’t be too crowded. Registration can be a wait so I’d recommend digital registration. \n","  review_date : May 31, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Recently stayed at this property for 5 nights, we were very pleased with the customer service we received during our check in. We were given a wonderful room in the diamond head tower with ocean view. Front desk agent gave us coupons for 2 free cupcakes @ wiki wiki market when she found out we were getting married ( didn’t get to try them). Overall I enjoyed the resort it was exactly what I expected the big resort with a big vacation feel! I loved our room and waking up to the wonderful ocean view cannot be topped. What I found was lacking was a few things for one, the housekeeping services, having been to many big chain hotels in major tourist cities, I felt they were lacking in this area. We would come back to the room to glasses still laying around and no glasses to reuse. (They provide two) I thought maybe they were tying not to throw away the drink but it’s clearly watered so... would’ve been nicer if put away. Another thing I didn’t not understand/like was the fact that there was no microwave in the property. They provide a mini fridge in the room but no microwave in a common area or in a market to reheat food, or anything. I thought maybe staff could’ve been more accommodating there and offered to help with heating up a meal, because there really must be a single microwave in the massive property. Really those were my two downsides. It’s great for families and if you’re going as a couple not wanting to see kids maybe stay elsewhere. Tropics bar was really nice with beach views but definitely resort prices. Took full advantage of bar at tapa tower.Tip:behind the lagoon there is a parking lot, look for yellow food truck.

I would not recommend staying at this place. It's very dirty and not a good location at all.

We loved the resort. Especially the pools and beach. Nice having a choice and all different, her favourite pool was the waterslide one, although the long slide closed at 5pm and the rest at 7pm which was a shame. The resort had a nice relaxed feel to it and even with hundreds of Cheerleaders it didn't feel as busy as ones we have been to in the Middle East, etc. The room was an ok size with a small balcony, very plain though. Fridge was very small. Lots of draws if you want to unpack and good sized wardrobe. We tended to mainly eat outside of the hotel as once the taxes & tip are added it was quite expensive. The ABC shops (2 in the resort) are great for breakfast, lunch and snack foods. As the resort is at the end of Waikiki Beach it isn't so busy but still walking (or short taxi ride) distance to the centre. We caught the bus into the centre 3x for dinner and taxi'd back. Ala Moana Mall (which is great for shopping and eating) is also walking distance (the the other direction). If you want loungers and umbrella's on the beach you need to pay to hire them so I recommend buying at Walmart if you plan to spend a few days on the beach. We stayed in the Tapa Tower. My only complaint with that tower was there was a live band every night at the Tapa Bar and the music was pretty loud in the room, especially Fri/Sat, until about 11pm.

Once without kids and once with. I think it is a fantastic place to stay just outside of the hustle and bustle of the city centre, and even more suited to families, especially with young kids. The pools are world class. You need to get there early to score a good chair poolside, but having said that hawaii doesn’t really wake up till around 10am!!!There is even a pool with water slides for kids of all ages and it’s easy to get food and drinks by the pool, making it somewhere where you can relax for most of the day before taking the 10min walk to the centre of town along the beachfront. I highly recommend staying at the Hilton Village when in Waikiki,Hawaii. You will be well looked after by the staff, get to relax (located just on the outside of the city centre) and there’s plenty to do. Towels are made available with the resort card, meaning you can trade for fresh clean pool towels once you have used them, saving you from trying to dry out and reuse towels when you get out of the water. Relax and enjoy your stay. \n","  review_date : May 25, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Well the hotel was in a great spot but dirty carpets red punch stain all over will this is a hard one had 2 bottle of wine and some other stuff taken from our room reported it.

It is a timeshare style resort, so the rooms are apartment style with kitchens, etc. We are not timeshare owners, so the booking was like a regular hotel, with housekeeping services every day.Management had sent me an e-mail indicating a different tower than I'd booked, so we had the taxi drop us off there. There was no wait for check in, but it was the wrong tower, so once checked in we had to roll our suitcases down the sidewalk to the Kalia tower (the nice lady at check in did offer to get someone to take us and our bag over in a cart, but we figured we could manage.)The Kalia tower is probably the furthest away from the main pool (it does have its own child free one) and our view was of the city, but it was quiet.There are a lot of amenities at this resort that we didn't have time for as we were only there for 3 nights prior to a cruise. The days that we were there were filled with sightseeing and the Hawaiian Village was a convenient base from which to explore.

We would like to thank Ceasar, Djodjo and Winnie for their concern for our comfort throughout our stay.

We are disappointed that we didn’t stay at the Royal Hawaiian our whole trip. If we go back to Hawai’i we will definitely go back there! Less crowds & kids and the hotel grounds were beautiful!!!Don’t stay at the Hilton!!!!The CONs- We arrived early, paid $50 to get a room earlier than the check in time and ended up getting a room right next to the elevators. Do not stay in the Alihi tower A-1301! It was noisy almost All night!! Especially on Friday after the fireworks. Also the room is located right above the only pool for the Alihi tower. So the kids are loud and obnoxious all day. They do not have an adults only pool, you have to go to a different Hilton down the street if you want one. It was nice but we didn’t like not having one at the hotel we were staying at. We forgot a few clothes once we left, we called them a few hours later and they claim they never saw them.....they never did find them. The PROs- there is a running track on the property, ABC stores all around, close to stuff we walked back from Diamond Head (1 hr or so but we stopped at a lot of places) and close to the Ala Moana shopping center and cruise terminal. If you stay in the Alihi tower you get a bracelet so you can skip lines for restaurants. Also it was nice to be able to see how busy the beach was and checking out a nice place to go before you go down to the beach right from your bedroom. The bathroom was nice but the tub was half the size of a normal sized tub. The fireworks were the best part but they were late and didn’t happen until around 8 o’clock\n","  review_date : May 20, 2019\n","\n","[parse_reviews] url: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii-or45.html?filterLang=en\n","[get_reviews_ids] data-reviewid: ['675345361', '675332069', '675131427', '675122103', '675011612']\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : I am sitting in the Tapa bar area of the Hilton Hawaiian Village as I type this, waiting to catch my Uber to the airport, on my last day of a 10 day visit to the resort.

I attended Yoga on the grassy knoll twice while here, a nice perk to staying there and the instructor was excellent. The views and the fact that it is a in a prime beach front property location is the only appeal to this hotel. Spending the amount of money we did to stay here to me was just simply not worth it. Especially given that the beach is not owned by any of the beachfront hotel properties in Waikiki, so essentially it doesn't really matter. There are quite a bit of disgruntled staff at this resort. Speaks to their employer...The views from our rooms were amazing...Again, due to the sheer location of this property is the only positive thing about it.

As soon as we arrived we were dumped on the end of a long, long queue filled with angry, impatient customers. The Hotel Lobby was a nightmare, understaffed and the front desk staff were rude and impatient. We booked on-line for a certain cost and when we got to the desk, we found out that we were going to be charged more than $45 per person per day cost for a rip-off Resort Fee to use facilities that we had no intention of using! We have never had to pay this Resort Fee anywhere else in the world so we were not happy and grateful that we only had to stay in this awful place for one day!

We had never stayed in a place so big but in saying this after a few days we got used to it and all of the amenities it had to offer. The convenience of a number of restaurants, bars, cafes, ice cream parlour on site as well as the ABC Stores was absolutely fantastic. Would highly recommend the Luau, good value, good quality food & entertainment great. We were allocated a Diamond Tower room, it was well maintained at all times, housekeeping staff very friendly and was nice to have a balcony even with a partial sea view. The only negative as such for us was the highly expensive rental fees for paddle boards, umbrella's etc to use on the beach & lagoon. Hence we didn't visit the beach at the hotel & strolled the short & comfortable walk to Waikikki for some waves & more reasonably priced equipment hire. We liked the hotel, however if we ever returned would probably not stay again and would go closer to Waikikki.

It’s long overdue for money to be spent on it. Presently there is drilling going on all day on one of the towers. This will continue till September. It’s noisy and if you are poolside very disruptive. We were told it happens on Mondays and Tuesdays. We have been to Hawaii many times. The staff in this hotel are not as good as other places we have stayed. They are not naturally friendly, interested or engaged. It’s clearly a numbers game - you are one of thousands and that’s how they treat you. The state of our room was appalling to say the least. Door that didn’t close, lights not working, chairs almost broken to say just a few things. Sofa looks 20 years old. Curtains are yellow. Paint is peeling off the doors. Clearly this is a hotel that brings in lots of money but the money doesn’t go back into it. Resort fee alone would bring them in around $200k a night when the hotel is full. For those who aren’t too particular it’s a good option. The noise is a problem for me, the state of the rooms is a problem in some towers. There are a lot of groups here which can also be a bit annoying and you feel overrun. If you do make a complaint or pass on feedback it’s just met with we will pass it on. Hilton should be better at this - they are one of the biggest hotel companies and they should have more respect for their guests than to let people book rooms in this state and listen to deafening noise on a hard earned expensive holiday.

Close to everything...the mall restaurants, shopping etc.As far as accommodations, I have 2 favorites. My first choice is the Alii tower. Best rooms are “05” rooms. These are corner rooms with much larger space and wrap around balconies. The most romantic room on the entire property! The staff at the Alii tower is as good as it gets in Hawaii. There is also their second floor which also offers a more private pool, best lounge chairs ,umbrellas and great service for food and drink. The maid service is impeccable and most accommodating. If I travel with my extended family, I opt for on of the many 1 or 2 bedroom timeshare units available to rent. Fireworks every Friday night ...and very romantic. Only down side is their restaurants.

Now as for the rest, we were aware that we would be up for some taxes when we arrived but seeing how we had just stayed the previous week in Maui (which is supposed to be more expensive than Oahu) when we checked in we were also notified that it would also be $45 US a day for parking so with taxes and parking it cost us another $750 Aus on top of the couple of grand we had already paid when booking 12mths prior and when compared to Maui which was a much nicer condo style apartment we only paid an extra $250 Aus. Now just to add to our check in frustrations the attendant actually said I will have to see what we have available and we were quite shocked considering we had booked so far in advance, then he asked “seeing how it’s your honeymoon I would highly recommend you upgrade to the rainbow tower as it has been newly renovated and that would be another $45 US a day”. Now I don’t know how they handle honeymoons in Honolulu normally and I do realise that they would get a large percentage of people coming there for this reason but when in Maui we were well looked after and people moved mountains to give you that extra special care and attention but at the Hilton Hawaiian they just saw it as as another chance to get more cash out of you and I honestly would have thought that an upgrade here or there would haven’t been too much trouble. After my wife politely telling them no thanks, we then asked where the parking was and was told where to go and after finally finding a park we had to haul our luggage about 600m to get to our tower and room!! To say we were less than impressed with the service provided by the Hilton staff at the front desk and there crazy parking prices for hotel guests would be an understatement and we would definitely recommend not staying here considering there are much nicer hotels in the same area where parking was a lot cheaper.We will not be back to the Hilton Hawaiian and my parents had planned on visiting this year also and we have also told them to look elsewhere.\n","  review_date : May 5, 2019\n","\n","[parse_reviews] url: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii-or75.html?filterLang=en\n","[get_reviews_ids] data-reviewid: ['671671798', '671602773', '671481777', '671476109', '671455165']\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : My wife and I started here at the Hilton before the start of our NCL cruise.

My getting stuff in and out wasn't an issue, but for the price of a nights stay, a dresser shouldn't have this issue. 2. Parking is extremely high.

Most of the beaches in the immediate Waikiki area aren’t all that amazing (in my opinion) but the lagoon is spot on. Especially if you were traveling with kids. Location wise, it’s on the extremity of the downtown Waikiki area, but it’s about an 8 to 10 min walk and you’re right in the mix.

Our travel agent had booked Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort for our overnight stay. Our cruise director thought this was your establishment so we were dropped off there. I want to bring to your attention the superior service we received from your standout employee Ms. Ginger Dillman. She was so very kind and caring. We were treated like VIP's. Ms. Dillman quickly put our fears and concerns to rest. She immediately focused on our needs and truly cared about our well being. Ginger called the Hilton Waikiki Beach Resort to confirm we were booked at that hotel. She then followed up by calling Charlie's Taxi and arranged to have us transported to that hotel. We were overwhelmed and so impressed she had given us a voucher to cover the cost of the taxi. All this for 3 Canadian Tourists who were not even staying at your Hotel. This is an excellent example of going well above and beyond all expectations. We have the pleasure of being world travellers in our retirement and this was, by far, the best care and attention we have ever received. Our highest praise goes to Ms. Ginger Dillman and our sincere appreciation and thanks to both Ginger and your incredible Hotel. Please pass along our great appreciation and admiration and thank you so much for such superior service. You can be assured we will be staying at your establishment if we return to Honolulu in the future. We will also share this story with our friends. Thank you, thank you.

Comically, many included green memes from her friends :)\n","  review_date : April 30, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : I booked this via Costco Travel, having spent six nights on Kauai I wanted a different taste of Hawaii. Well, Oahu is definitely different than Kauai! Hello big city!!I did not rent a car here. I did manage to walk 10 miles around the city seeing the zoo, aquarium, and making a stop at Leonard’s for malasadas (I liked the custard filled ones the best). One fun thing I noticed was Oahu was about 60% Asian tourists. This midwestern girl got a kick out of the attire and selfie sticks! Positives:It’s a Hilton. You know what to expect: comfy beds, a solid TV, a decent sized bathroom. The shower was pretty nice, steady temps considering I was on the 25th floor. Plenty of towels. The shampoo/conditioner/lotion was one of the best smelling I’ve come across (and I travel for business quite a bit). No issues getting an elevator quickly. (This was very Vegas-like to me) I was in the Kailia (sp?) Tower, so buildings closer to the beach may have busier elevators. Nice to have a fridge! Lots of shopping and restaurants on site, you really don’t have to leave the premises (Vegas style). Honolulu Cookie Co! Free Samples people! I ended up buying quite a few tins as gifts for my family. They freeze for up to six months, so I’ll freeze my box next to the Girl Scout Cookies I bought earlier this year. The ABC stores are great for whatever....the Walgreens/CVS of Hawaii. Negatives:If you request an ‘Ocean facing room’ it is definitely NOT an ocean front room. Don’t spend the extra on the four foot ‘balcony’ with generic patio furniture. You can’t see past the bars and the sunset is blocked by the other buildings. I could technically see the ocean, from about half a mile away. AC unit only went to 68 degrees. I got fairly warm at night. No ceiling fan to help circulate the air and the fan wouldn’t change modes. I wanted to book a tour of Pearl Harbor. However I didn’t have a concierge in my tower. When I called I got pricing and two different offerings, I wanted to research them on the Internet before committing. When I called back 10 minutes later, it went to voicemail. I left my details for a return call and never received one. I wanted a late checkout. After three voicemails to the front desk, I pressed ‘0’ somewhere along the way and got a person who could approve it. For a resort with people coming and going at all hours, I expected better availability. Overall, it wasn’t worth the splurge.\n","  review_date : April 30, 2019\n","\n","[parse_reviews] url: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii-or90.html?filterLang=en\n","[get_reviews_ids] data-reviewid: ['670504361', '670482335', '670469906', '670327128', '670317880']\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : This hotel is very, very large. Something like 3200 rooms on 22 acres. Multiple towers throughout the property with many stores, shops and eating establishments. Right on Waikiki Beach with it's own private lagoon. Also close to the pier which takes you on the Submarine tour. Five minute fireworks every Friday. Many pools, music throughout the day at various bars. Pricey but this is Hawaii (everything is expensive). Walking with a cane can be very tiring as the walking areas consist of various materials (flagstone, brick,coblestone etc) Nice feature is the electric vehicles that you can request to get from here to there, free but tipping is accepted. These are nice as mentioned before walking could be hard for some as some places you may want to go are quite a distance. All excursions seem to leave from the same general area which could be quite far from where you begin. The only place that seemed crowded were the ABC stores. This is where we bought the following days breakfast as our tours started fairly early and it was easier to eat in the rooms.

Great live music every night. Great shopping opportunities in the village but watch out for hard sell. This was the one thing I disliked about the resort - some places were over priced and used pressure sell tactics. Totally awesome beach and the Mandara spa is definitely worth a visit. Perk to the spa visit is the adult only pool area. The other Pools and lagoon are great for kids.Several activities associated with the hotel - the Luau, the submarine Atlantis, turtle canyon, catamaran sail... and several others easily available by shuttle that picks you up at the resort.

They have two ABC stores for anything you need (groceries/alcohol/toiletries/souvenirs). All the pools were great and water is cold at first, but not terrible. Our daughter loved the slides and tapa pool. Loved the option of walking to the pool, ocean, or lagoon. Prices for rentals (chairs/umbrellas/paddle board/etc) were insane! We just packed a beach blanket and settled for shade under the palm tree. We stayed at the tapa tower with a resort view and had a little view of the ocean. Even if we didn’t get a grand view, it was still a great spot since it was close to everything and we barely spent time in the room. Though we asked for a king bed we were given a room with double beds and were offered the Ali’i tower for extra and a early check in for extra as well. Got to the fireworks show 5 min before it started and still got a great view. Tons and tons of international tourists, conventions, and vacationers, but not an inconvenience. I loved how they had so many people to help translate for others as well. We opted out of eating anything at the resort, but the happy hours and drinks are great.Some negatives: our daughter got a scratch on her face from one of the pillows guessing it was the zipper. Bathtub had horrible drainage and our key for the parking garage didn’t work the first two days, but workers always came instantly to help.Overall it was a great experience. People usually go to spend their whole vacation at the resort, which is fine, but there’s so much more to do in Oahu. The resort does offer everything for all ages. It was a great home base and accessible to everything.

The lobby is a maze.3. There is a hard sell (buy this! updgrade that!) that screams of desperation. The staff member who checked us in told us there was a kettle in our room, after overselling us, and there wasn't.4. The chest of drawers in our room would not close fully, causing a trip hazard.5. It is very, very busy: just like the Sheraton Waikiki, but less well designed and felt more crowded and less well organised.6. Yoga classes at the ungodly hour of 6!7. Terrible TV channels and no interesting shows to watch. Not good if you want to chill after a long day of travel/ work.8.

I went for the Charley’s Philli, their chicken and loaded fries was a welcomed treat!There are plenty of day trips out, out and if you can use computer/smart phone you can save 10% by booking online, if you are a serving member of the military or veteran add an extra %20 saving!We have fallen in love with Waikiki and will definitely be returning in the near future, however as we have stayed in the Hilton Hawaiian Village now, so next time we’ll probably try somewhere else.Paradise island it truly was...The Aloha spirt awaits my return Aloha x\n","  review_date : April 24, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : We stayed in the Rainbow Tower of the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki beach on the 30th floor.

This is not the place to be if you want a quiet relaxing vacation. It's a central location in Waikiki and alot of visitors flock to it. You know when you just want to go to the lobby looking like a hot mess to buy something from the ABC store? Well you'd have to completely get ready to do that or you might run into a sea of 50 people heading to an event because it also has a convention center. Food at the restaurants were minimum $100 for basic meals. Even RoundTable was $100 for 1 pizza, 1 salad and 4 sodas. Get your wallet out if you want to go to Waikiki as it is but be prepared to pay more here. The rooms were actually clean at Tapa on the 34th floor and quiet! Thank God! We had plenty of towels and the AC kept the room nice and cool. The pools were always packed with kids so we just went to the beach. To rent an umbrella and 2 lounge chairs at the beach is $50 and to paddle board for 3 hours is another $50. The Uber pick up is in one location, the bus's are somewhere else, the lobby is somewhere else..I was lost up until 2 days before we left lol.

We were moved to the Tapa Tower and placed on the same floor with a good deal of searching from the front desk manager. The rooms were better, but still a bit tired.

The choice of restaurants is limited, but if you choose not too, you don’t have to leave the resort. There is very limited shade around any of the pools (that’s if you can get a seat) & it cost ($35US) to hire an umbrella at the lagoon or beach, plus $18US each for a lounge. The water activities are also highly priced at $US45 an hour for most things. We stayed in the Rainbow tower which was comfortable & in a good location. It was a small walk to the shops, but in front of the lagoon & beach. (Wouldn’t stay in the Lagoon tower) even though it’s right on the kids pool & lagoon, it’s too far away from anything else. Same with the other towers, they are near the shops & restaurants, but far from the beach, lagoon & kids pool. Our room was clean, but the double beds proved to be a problem. They certainly need to be queen size, especially for a larger family.

My family decided to stay their for the weekend since we I have a ball to attend. We checked it around 0430 went to the room to get ready. We all left the room around 0530. Hubby was incharged with the kids, according to him they stayed at the beach the whole time and wasn't able to get back to the room around 8pm. While waiting for the girls to get done showering as my son walk towards the deck he stepped on a broken glass he was crying so bad due to excruciating pain. Hubby did some first aid and advised him to lay down as soon as he lay he got stabbed again with another piece of glass in his legs. My husband called the front desk 3 times yet no one came in to clean the room nor give any first aid assistance. After a long week of work that is the last thing my husband wanted he was hoping to relaxed but due to the incident he was stressed. He was so worried that my other 2 kids will get injured so he policed the room since no one showed up. I arrived around 11 as soon as I stepped in the room went straight to take a shower and I notice blood aon the tub and bathroom floor. So I asked my daughter who is still awake and she informed me of what had happened. Since everyone is already asleep I just depend on what my daughter told me and I started msgng the hotel thru their app. Informed them that I am so dissapointed regarding the incident but since it is too late I will get the band aid in the morning and no need for house keeping since its almost 1230am. I have trouble sleeping the time that I was about to fall asleep sleep a staff knock to offer a first aid, I was so mad but since he looked so concern I controlled my temper on top of that I do not wake up the my family. So I just grab a couple of band aid and when I checked the clock it is 0130 am. I wasn't able to go back to sleep after that. So after breakfast I went to the manager on duty and informed what happened. Suprisingly the 3initial call wasn't reported no wonder no one came in. He offered to extend our check out till 3pm and a $15 icecream. My son looked at me and said \"wow this is just how much my suffering cost and yet you paid 10x to stay here mom\". Since I do not have energy I just left and emailed the hilton customer service as well as post this feedback. For a hotel chain like Hilton as customer we expect a higher standard. But experiencing this kind of incident inside the room was so dissapointing. They should always put their customer and staff safety first at all time.

I did not do this on Hilton Hawaiian because in the app recommend to book the desired room due to high occupancy season will limit the available upgrades.When i got to the lobby for check in i was not expecting or requesting an upgrade i just handed my passport to the reception guy. The reception guy after see my membership he thank me for my loyaly as they usually do in every hilton. I right after he ask me if first time in honolulu which i said yes it is. Then he ask me if i would like to have ocean front instead of my current partial ocean booking, because as a holiday i should enjoy the best views. I reply him yes that i would love to have the front ocean, then 15 min later checking his computer for available rooms, he said that i was lucky cause they had available rooms, i quickly got excited about this for just few seconds until he said that i had to pay for this room the rate difference. I was truly in shock that all his nice words and everything was just to sell me a more expensive room!!. I ask him why i have to pay when im diamond and diamond offer free upgrade, his answer was because ali tower is too premium and it does not free upgrades never. Only the cheap towers have upgrades. This is a total lie, diamond include premium rooms and suite upgrade as well, and i was already paying for a premium room in the premium tower.Anyway i reject his \"offer\" and head to my room, i will resume the rest of wrong things about this hotel:- room was not clean (there was food in the fridge from previous guest)- 40usd compulsory daily resort fee include movies (not so big selections of them and now with netflix make this kind of useless) and play station 3 with just 2 games for rent. - room is not that luxury or well design as they try to sell you. Horrible shower.- safe deposit box need to pay extra- ali tower swimming pool is small, also jacuzzi is dirty and small- staff are uncapable of following any simple request need to call them multiple times.- no breakfast include no matter which level or room you have, only 10usd daily credit just for diamonds, which cover only the tips for the waiter when you go to their restaurants.- beach chair, snorkel or anything you need for enjoying the beach is not included need to pay extra money and is not cheap.- parking almost 50usd when across the road have parking for 16usd daily.- too crowd to enjoy anything- no cameras anywhere, no security at all!!This hotel is a tourist trap!, oahu is a nice island, not as nice as the big island but worth it to go.

The first time I came, I was so in awe of Hawaii that I probably overlooked some glaring annoyances about this property. The Hilton is not relaxing. I think I heard screaming children and infants every time I stepped out of my room. The focus is on families and as someone traveling with friends, we felt neglected by this resort.The $45 nightly resort fee is a rip-off. It goes towards WiFi, activities and a bunch of crap that doesn’t mean anything. I took a lei making class which was enjoyable but didn’t feel like it warranted a resort fee. That’s an activity you can pay $5-$10 to do one time. I have never used any of the pools because they are overcrowded and again, filled with screaming children.Dining options are dismal. Either have a $150 subpar dinner at Tropics or starve, I guess? Breakfast was particularly hard. Either you spend $70 on eggs and toast at Tropics or you can go to Starbucks, spend maybe $30 but wait in line for almost an hour. Not kidding, from the time I got in line to the time I walked out of the store, it had been nearly 45 minutes. There’s no where in the resort where you can just grab a quick coffee and be done with it. We requested Diamond Head Tower because I like the tower’s proximity to things. We paid an “upgrade fee” for an ocean view room. The view was indeed spectacular, but the surrounding noise wasn’t. Our room was on the Eastern side of the tower and overlooked the back of the neighboring hotel, Hale Koa. During the day, we were treated to nonstop construction noise from Hale Koa and loud trucks making deliveries to Hale Koa- everyday, all day. At night time, their beachfront bar blasted music so loud, I could hear it with our lanai doors closed. If you’re struggling to get used to the time change and are looking for a good nights sleep, you will have to sleep according to the Hale Koa’s live music schedule. Totally unacceptable. I felt stupid paying an upgraded fee for a room that wasn’t the least bit quiet. Ocean view be damned.The rooms are dated and nothing spectacular. There’s barely any charging outlets and the the furniture is just old and ugly. There is nothing modern about these rooms. My bathroom in my tiny Manhattan apartment was bigger than the bathroom in our room - pretty sad. Price gouging is rampant throughout the restaurants and retail shops. Plan to go bankrupt before you head home. I used the Mandara Spa for a massage and didn’t have any complaints. It was an average experience for above average prices, but that’s a running theme in this hotel. I do have to say I have never had an issue with the staff and everyone was friendly and helpful. Housekeeping staff was particularly friendly and efficient - they were probably the most consistent thing about the hotel experience. They left our rooms perfect at the end of each day and always said hello when we saw them in the hall. All of this being said, I am not returning to this hotel. I am looking for a more upscale, relaxing experience and the Hilton does not offer this between outdated rooms and the amount of children running like monsters throughout this resort. This hotel is like the Hawaiian version of Six Flags. If that’s your thing, cool. However, you can catch me on the North Shore of Oahu next time or the adults only resort on Maui.\n","  review_date : April 13, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : This hotel is located right on the beach, which is great. However for the money we spent we felt ripped off. The food choices were limited and just not worth the money we spent. The best meal we had was on the O’ahu nature tour of the north coast at a local place called Fumi’s. The elevators are in need of paint which is an easy fix. The air conditioner doesn’t go below 68 so you’re out of luck if you like your room cooler. You can’t sit on your balcony after sunset since there is no light outside. There are also way too many people at any given time, most of them with screaming kids.We will not be returning to the Hilton Hawaiian Village.

My room’s air conditioner was very loud. Sounded like an old bathroom vent fan combined with the rattling of a locomotive. Spoke to x2 managers (a challenge in itself) and told them I was not satisfied. They had folks change the filters, but it did not help. While I was in the room, I kept the AC off... including while I slept. Not what I’d expect at a ‘resort’. Food prices were outrageous. Quality unimpressive. Security around the hotel was lacking.

It was amazing. It had everything you imagine. Let me start with the beach, lagoon, and pools. The lagoon was fabulous. I couldn’t imagine having a better lagoon. You could snorkel and do anything you wanted in the lagoon. You were even able to rent out paddle boards, boats, canoes, water trikes, and so much more. Now the pools were great too. I would say though, the one pool with the water slide was a bit on the small side, and was hard to find a seat (basically like every pool), but had a great water slide and was family friendly. Now let’s get to the amazing beach. OMG! The view of Honolulu was spectacular. You could see all the way from Diamondhead to the end of Honolulu. The sun set over the water and was just overall beautiful. The resort itself was great, with all the luxury’s you could think of. You had a Louis Vuitton store on the property (one of my favorites), jewelry, a great cookie company called Honolulu cookie company, and much more. The restaurants ranged from casual dining to fancy and classical. The service was amazing and everybody was friendly, especially the locals. Now, Honolulu is like California. There are some scratchy parts, and things can be different. But everything is just beautiful in the end. I’m not saying that California isn’t a beautiful place, but can have some sketchy areas, just like every tiger city. So, if your looking to go to one of the islands, I would highly consider this hotel to be one of your options.

Spoke with two managers who were not helpful and short but she eventually apologized. Finally got escalated to the higher manager and he kept emphasizing they have to follow protocol. We have no money, had to cancel our credit cards and freeze our bank accounts. Hilton said as a gesture from them they will comp one meal, breakfast, lunch or dinner, nothing else. They offered a taxi voucher for us to go to a bank but our accounts are frozen and our bank isn’t even here on this island! No manager came to our room and even showed their face which obviously lacks the the importance of what just happened to our family. No one checked to see if we were okay and in general customer service here was terrible. We had to make the request ourselves to even change rooms! We were treated like a transaction, no empathy for how violated we were. We are all so shaken up and this whole experience has made us weary about traveling in general. This is such a sad and unfortunate experience that we never imagined would ever happen to us. Would never stay here again or any Hilton brand if this is how they treat their guests.

After waiting in line for over 20 minutes to check in, we were advised that our reservation was split into two reservations running back to back, but that they would merge them. At the end of the first reservation we were notified that we were to check out. Spoke with the front desk and were told not to worry, the merge was taken care of. The next morning the housekeeper knocked and asked how soon we would be leaving the room and checking out. Back to the front desk to be told that all was well and that we did not need to check out until the end of our second reservation! When we checked in, we were advised that an ADDITIONAL charge of $45 per day would be charged, in addition to what was paid in advance, for a \"Daily Resort Charge\" whick amounted to not much more than a fee for WiFi access. Now, please bear in mind that I have live in Honolulu twice during my adult life and that I have stayed in this hotel several times since it was a Kaiser Hotel. This visit was a major departure from the services that I previously enjoyed! The charges for food and drinks were unbelieveably expensive. A single small glass of house wine was $17. A hamburger was in excess of $25. Need I say more about price gouging?! To go further, maintenance was less than what was expected. Broken tile in the bathroom. Torn chair on the lanai.

First of, the beach in front of the Hilton is definitely the nicest out of the whole Waikiki area. Actually, it's probably 10 times wider than the rest of Waikiki. So you are not packed like sardines in a can;) The pools are big and right next to the beach. There is a man made pond for the little ones where you can try paddle boarding or surf breaks right in front of the hotel in case you want to learn how to surf. Also the landscaping, ponds with fish and turtles, parrots, tiki torches lid up every evening by a man dressed like a proper Hawaiian (read: almost naked) it all adds to the experience! It really feels like a paradise. As far as the location - it's located about 10 min walk to Waikiki's most touristy street Kalakaua Av. It's a very nice walk, most of it right next to the beach. Perfect for catching a sunset. It's also about 10 min from Ala Moana - Hawaii's best shopping mall with fun bars/restaurants with more of a local feel.

We stayed six nights in a 2 bedroom condo in the Lagoon Tower and had a fabulous time!Pros:The condo was great. Clean, updated, beautiful view, full kitchen, laundry room around the corner with 2 machines that were always open. The lagoon area is wonderful, especially in the morning before it gets too crowded with water toys. It is close to the tower and shallow.The beach is nice, too. It is wide and wasn’t too crowded. The water was warmer than the lagoon, definitely bearable at this time of year.The pools are great. The lagoon pool’s water slides were fun and the wide steps are great for little ones. We loved the Tapa pool. Again, the wide steps are great for toddlers and the pool temperature was probably upper 80s. The village is convenient, especially the ABC stores. Lapperts or Dairy Queen were fun for ice cream. The grounds are beautiful. Our kids loved watching the fish and turtles in the ponds.Friday night fireworks were a fun treat. Cons:Food prices in the hotel restaurants are very, very expensive. Chairs were hard to come by around the pools.Parking rates are ridiculous. You have to pay every time you come out. It isn’t charged to your room. Tips:Whole Foods is about a 10 min drive. We ate breakfast and lunch in our condo to keep costs down. Lapperts coffee is good. Cheaper than Starbucks and a shorter line, too. We did the luau at Experience Nutridge. A much smaller, more unique experience than the luau on top of the parking garage. We loved it. We loved our trip to the Northshore. We swam in the waterfall at Waimea Falls and stopped at Seven Brothers and Matsumoto Shave Ice on the way back.

The staff really went above and beyond to make sure our stay and celebration was epic and unforgettable. Aloha spirit is alive and well.We live on the west side of the island of Oahu. The Hilton Hawaiian Villiage is the largest property on Waikiki beach and is setup in prime location. With a large and perfect waikiki beachfront, with activities on site for all ages, and between Ala Moana shopping center and the shops and restaurants of Waikiki. You can stay on site the whole time you are there, or easily walk to the best of what Waikiki has to offer. They have a wide beachfront with walk up access to watersports including the Atlantis submarine and a catamaran boat. The beach is protected by reef making the water safe for the kids to play without big waves to manage. They also have a salt water lagoon that is clean, safe, and perfect to try out SUP or an aqua bike. They have multiple pools for adults and children, however the popular pools can get very crowded, especially the one with the waterslides and jacuzzi. You can be active or just relax and still have a memorable experience.What really made the stay epic started with the staff. The Hilton is blessed with amazing leaders like Debi and Chasity, who are very passionate about caring for their guests and making sure every moment spent on site is memorable. They were very attentive and responded at night and even on the weekends. Despite our visit being during the busy spring break, they helped us find a room with an amazing view and were always available to help us with anything we needed. I will always be appreciative of their generosity and focus on customer service and satisfaction. They alone helped make me a Hilton believer.As for our room, we stayed in a one bedroom suite in the Tapa Tower on the 28th floor. As you walk around the resort you will notice a number of towers recently built beautiful and brand new. The Tapa Tower was one of the original resort towers that has a distinct hawaiian kapa design and feel to it. As you will read in some other reviews, the Tapa tower is indeed dated, especially compared to the newer towers, but still a solid tower and it did not take away anything from our stay. The room was BIG and spacious, with TWO balconies that each gave us a different and unique experience. I spent a lot of time on the balconies just in awe of the views of the ocean, sunset, beautiful resort, and starlight luau from one balcony. And enjoying my coffee from the bedroom balcony in the morning waking up with the city view and watching the clouds form at the green Ko'olau mountains and slowly make their way across the sky.With 1.5 baths, the kids had their own place to wash up and get ready, nobody had to wait for the bathroom.The living room was huge, it had a TV, a sofa bed big enough for our two kids, a wet bar and mini fridge, and a dining table right in front of corner windows with a panoramic view of ocean to mountain.The maid service was awesome, leaving extra towels for us when we left a note before going out to the pools. I'm sure we could have asked for any kind of convenience and the staff would try their best to help us.There are also activities included in the resort fee. They have outdoor movies on the lawn on certain nights where we laid out a picnic blanket and ate take out dinner from a nearby restaurant while we watched the movie. They also have morning yoga and hula lessons on the lawn that were fun.All in all, we had a great time.

Disappointed, I agreed to the higher rate. Upon arrival, my boyfriend (a local business owner) and myself were lectured by the front desk staff member about how we should not qualify for the Kama'aina rate because we are white.

Received a check in via text each day, and while i didn’t have any problems, they appeared ready to get into fixit mode.

Started in the Kalia Tower, then switched to the Rainbow Tower. Being a frequent traveler, I ignored reading most of the reviews about the shear size of the property, along with the somewhat-confusing check-in situation. It is a bit daunting when you first arrive, trying to figure out which line to stand is, as there are people everywhere. The staff was helpful, but lines moved slowly. Bottom line is that you are really paying for the prime location and over abundance of restaurants, shops, pools, etc. Once we made it our room, we were disappointed with the Kalia Tower King Room. Decent ocean view but the furnishings felt worn and the tower in general seemed a bit dated. The only really nice feature is the adults-only pool and the 4th floor workout facility, which is large are pretty crowded by 6am. We were able to switch to the Rainbow tower on Day 2, which had a better view/location and also felt a little newer and nicer. The main pool area was busy, but not really any different than Disneyworld or Vegas pools. We always found chairs. Since we were there in late March, it was extremely crowded and that took away from my expectation of it being a more relaxing destination. The beach and lagoon areas at the hotel are very nice, and you can't beat the sunsets. A lot of the excursion transportation companies pick up very close to the hotel, so if you do those, you don't have far to walk. Overall, I would give it 4.5 out of 5. The biggest detractor is that it is so big and busy all of the time. If that is your thing, then go for it. If your are looking for a more secluded type of vacation, don't choose Waikiki Beach area, as there are people everywhere.\n","  review_date : April 4, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : I went with my 70 yr old mother and 2 16 yr old girls and everyone had a great time.

A shout out to our housekeeper for Room 1434 in the Tapa building for the week of March 26th (sorry, didn't get her name) who was absolutely OUTSTANDING!!!We were there over Spring Break so, as to be expected, it was crowded however, never had an issue finding a spot on the beach. Lambert's coffee and ice cream shop is a MUST. The carrot cake and cinnamon buns were delicious - coffee considerably better (and less expensive) than Starbuck's. We didn't eat on the resort except for a happy hour at the Japanese restaurant which was very tasty and reasonably priced (for a Honolulu resort ;-) )\n","  review_date : April 3, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : We had an Ocean View Room in Ali’i Tower. The room was nice and I definitely recommend this tower due to the private check-in, concierge, pool, etc...My only complaints were 1)I asked if booking with a 3rd party site was frowned upon. I was told the only difference was that I wouldn’t get the Hilton points...that’s fine since booking with Expedia was roughly $500 cheaper. Now that we’re here, I’m told that I don’t get the extra benefits of being a Gold member since I didn’t book direct. 2)My wife and I are celebrating 15 years together, so I called and asked for champagne to be in the room. The gentleman I spoke with assured me he would leave a note in the system and that they would do something nice. Instead, the man at check-in said he had no knowledge of our anniversary and they can’t send champagne to the room. He offered me...2 cupcakes. Mind you, I didn’t ask for anything free. I just wanted it in my room, but instead I get offered 2 cupcakes.

Located on a 22 acre parcel right on Waikiki Beach, there are about five towers with rooms, the most famous tower being the \"Rainbow Tower\". There were at least 20 different restaurants of various cuisines and desserts. There were five pools, a saltwater lagoon between the \"Rainbow Tower\" and the ocean and a spa. There is plenty of shopping with 90 shops, as well as a number of kids' activities - if you need a break. There is even a small garden with over 60 different species of exotic birds, fish and animals. Though, not finally, but not to be forgotten, every Friday night guests can enjoy a fireworks display along Waikiki Beach. This is also a great place to come and visit and stroll the shops and restaurants, as well as people watch. Are the prices expensive? Well, you are on Hawaii, so the prices are not cheap.\n","  review_date : April 3, 2019\n","\n","[parse_reviews] url: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii-or180.html?filterLang=en\n","[get_reviews_ids] data-reviewid: ['663336047', '663307379', '663270943', '663204381', '663174126']\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : The Hilton was very nice.

The Starbucks coffee shop was very expensive as was food at the hotel. The staff was very nice and helpful.

Seeing some of the reviews on here, I expected a tired room far from the resort's amenities. This couldn't have been further from the truth! The room had a king bed, a comfy sofabed and more than enough space for an air mattress for our 2yo. Best of all, our \"partial ocean view\" went from the ocean and lagoon to the mountains behind the resort. To be sure, the decor is a bit dated but the room was very clean, the A/C worked, the beds were comfortable, and we very rarely heard noises from adjoining rooms. The Tapa pool right outside the elevator lobby, and the other pools and beach were a 5 min stroll through the resort's koi ponds and landscaped gardens.Pools: The variety of pools was great for our 2yo and 5yo, from the Paradise Pool with water slides, to the large kids pool by the beach, to the cozy Tapa pool (we didn't make it to the Kalia pool, which doesn't allow kids, but it did look like an oasis for aduts).The Beach: This is probably the best stretch of beach in Waikiki. While some sections are narrow, the beach here is wide and never felt overly crowded. Food: Yes, food here is pricey, but not out of line with resorts. For bargains, you can grab hot dogs or sandwiches at the WikiWiki or DQ for $5-8 each, and for more variety, head further into Waikiki or to the nearby Ala Moana mall.Camp Penguin: Our 5yo absolutely loved it. She went there two days and would have gladly gone more if we stayed longer. \n","  review_date : April 2, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Busy place but lots of fun!

Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, a person in our party was unable to travel. Although we booked everything six months ago, I was told that I needed to rebook the hotel when I called the Hilton just a couple weeks before our stay. They couldn’t honor the original price, therefore we needed to rebook through Snap Travel to get a comparative price and therefore, since we booked with an outside company, the Hilton would not honor our Gold member status. This put a damper on the trip as we did not receive our complimentary breakfast, any hotel points or the free waters that are included for Gold members.Arrival and check in- There were long lines for check in when we arrived at the resort shortly after 3:30. Room- Not as spacious as the Outrigger. We had two double beds. Our room was in the Rainbow tower on the 29th floor with a gorgeous view. I would definitely recommend this tower/floor with partial ocean view. Great location to watch the sunsets. The towels in the room are bigger than the towels given at the pool. I requested late check out (noon) and I was told that they could not accommodate because they book 98% full most of the year so this was an unreasonable request. I did receive late check out without a problem at the Outrigger.Perks- A big plus for this hotel was the DVD rental kiosk in the lobby. New releases were offered and it was so convenient. We got a movie every night. We also loved the lei making. When were arrived at the resort, we couldn’t sign up because it was already full, but they were able to squeeze us in when we showed up at the scheduled time.Pool- The pool was crowded. At the Hilton, we needed to provide a towel card each time we wanted a towel and you were only able to get one miniature sized towel that didn’t even cover half the beach chair. If you lost your towel cards you would be charged a fee. At Outrigger the towels were big and plentiful. The attendant had no gripes about handing out additional towels. There are no floats, toys or balls allowed in the pool area. One morning my kids were at the pool the second it opened, they were the only ones there and they still were yelled at for bringing a small ball into the pool area. Beach- The Outrigger offers complimentary beach toys and boogie boards. Hilton charged a fee to rent these items. Lagoon- This was a great place for the kids to hang out. We rented the aqua bikes for the lagoon, which was fun. Also a great place to paddleboard, snorkel and play around in the water.Hotel Service was not very good. I called the front desk a few times and had to wait very long periods of time for a response and was transferred to several people. I was hung up on several times. We tried to go see the outdoor movie which was scheduled for 6pm. By 6:30 there was still no one to be found and no movie showing so we just left.Location- The Hilton Hawaiian Village was more secluded than the Outrigger, which is in the heart of Waikiki. Shopping is plentiful. Many ABC stores are close by with groceries or extras if necessary. The ABC store is a great place to stock up on water since it is not included in your stay. I would also recommend getting a boogie board or floats here for your stay rather than renting them. Ends up being less expensive.Restaurants- The nachos at Tropics were great and the view wonderful. A great place to watch the sunset. We did not wait for a table and dined on the patio by the beach. Restaurants at the Hilton Hawaiian Village are expensive (more expensive than Outrigger). It was $10 for a beer at Hilton and $7 at Outrigger. $7 for a coffee at Starbucks. Although the Dairy Queen offers an affordable alternative. Lappert’s ice cream was phenomenal. Possibly the best ice cream I have ever had.We would not stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village again. There are so many great options in the area and after staying at the Outrigger Waikiki Beach Resort and getting the royal treatment there, I would not choose the Hilton Hawaiian Village.\n","  review_date : April 1, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : It was our first trip to Hawaii and I must say the Hotel was beautiful.

They did not complain one time about being bored or unsatisfied. There are many pools attached to this venue, and they are all impeccably designed. They are clean and the staff are attentive. there are several bars located around the area for the adults who want to just unwind. there is shopping and decent food in the venue. The prices are probably over inflated for the food, but it is a hotel so you can't expect too much more. There are convenient stores located around the area, which are very handy to stock-up your fridge for a late night snack or a drink. Starbucks and another coffee shop are located on the premises. Note for all our Australian travellers, the coffee and the food is American standard, so don't expect to be too satisfied with the coffee or the food. i know our American friends enjoy the coffee, but us Australians (especially the melbourne comers) will not find a good coffee any where in America. The rooms are clean, and decently sized. I believe all rooms have a balcony. not a smokers friendly location. But in saying that, Hawaii is not very smokers friendly. I know this smoke free venue will entice most of you. But for the smokers (who are equally human with their own rights and expectation of not being discriminated against) will find Hawaii in general a challenging, but the positive, you'll smoke less. Just don't expect to enjoy a smoke with your drink. All that said, over all this place is perfect. I know in the heading i said \"kid Friendly\", but that does not discount the fact that the place is perfect for couples or lone travellers. If i were to return to Hawaii with just my partner and no kids, i would stay at this place. Only thing i would avoid is the pool with the slide, that pool has a LOT of kids around it for obvious reasons. we did not get breakfast with out package, but as mentioned above, there are plenty of eateries around the complex that serve up decent food (large proportions). you can't go wrong with this place.\n","  review_date : March 25, 2019\n","\n","[parse_reviews] url: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii-or210.html?filterLang=en\n","[get_reviews_ids] data-reviewid: ['661243768', '661207894', '660915018', '660836810', '660743607']\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : This resort is beautiful. We stayed in the grand islander tower. Had a beautiful view and a beautiful room. The resort has so much to do. Places to shop, swim, eat and drink! All the people we encountered were nice. We would most definitely stay at this resort again. The only downfall is they don’t clean the room every day. And there’s always a lot of sand and trash. And no way to clean the counters unless you go but your own cleaning spray.

The hotel grounds are elegant, well kept and just off the beach where you can take lovely walks enjoying the beautiful sunset. As well there is an extremely convenient bus route that runs right in front of the hotel and several hotel onsite “ABC” general stores too. We enjoyed so much about this hotel including the coi ponds, morning yoga and beautiful “partial ocean views” form the balcony. Here are some areas I think could be improved upon:- the pools at each tower locations were ridiculously cold, and it seemed to me, that with exception to the Paradise Pool area - there were no other hot tubs! I thought that we’d spend much of our holiday swimming and lazing about the pool.... we did not do this at all as it was simply too cold and therefore not enjoyable. I’d recommend that the pools are heated a few degrees warmer, and that each location includes a hot tub. The resort fee seems excessive particularly when you don’t enjoy the facilities -there are no recycling blue bins in the rooms and overall the hotel seems to generate a huge amount of plastic waste serving- staff at mandara spa do not seem to answer the phone. After trying to book an appointment 4 days in a row, I walked over to the spa and spoke to spa reception to make an appointment. It was not busy and so I’m not sure why they did not answer their phones?!- lagoon grill restaurant (located at paradise pools location) served terrible and horrendously expensive processed food. We paid $100 USD for nachos (with processed cheese), a salad and two hot dogs. We were not impressed. While our server was very kind, the food was terrible.\n","  review_date : March 24, 2019\n","\n","[parse_reviews] url: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii-or215.html?filterLang=en\n","[get_reviews_ids] data-reviewid: ['660649206', '660596983', '660550425', '660380690', '660379333']\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : The resort was comfortable with beautiful views and all the shopping you need.

We have been to several different hotels but have never had a problem going back to HHV. The location for us is ideal as it’s close enough to walk to Waikiki and far enough away from the busy strip. We have stayed in the Lagoon, Ali and Diamond towers and this time stayed in the Tapa and were very happy with our unit and floor. We noticed recent reviews about the pools being colder and I would say that it did seem that way. However when it is warm you will appreciate it and also they were much less crowded. Resort has a nice 24 hour gym. Self parking is very easy and convenient. For Friday fireworks we watch from the beach just past the Tropics Bar by the Port Hilton. It is a fantastic view and less crowded and you can enjoy the sunset before the fireworks. During our recent trip we had an issue that we felt we were treated unfairly and we mentioned it to the Manager on duty. She was very respectful and understanding and to our surprise on checkout, the resort gave us a credit. We are very thankful for the way the resort treats their guests. \n","  review_date : March 23, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Your locationHilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Booked an ocean view room but the football field sized parking garage that you have to look at over your balcony to get the ocean view is beyond HIDEOUS. For 300 a night you cannot get a simple cup of coffee that you can even get in a motel 6...lol how is that possible in a resort. The coffee maker in the room does not work, it spits a few ounces out and stops. They sent a new one and it does the same thing. The Starbucks in the lobby is terrible, I would know because we are from Seattle. There are no restaurants at this hotel or anything else besides the lone Starbucks. So no enjoying a good morning coffee on the balcony. This hotel is the only one with an adult pool but it is also the only one without a bar so no \"adult\" beverages while enjoying the pool, another mind boggling annoyance. The room was just ok, I would say it's less than most normal mainland brand name hotels. Furniture was scuffed and scraped to the point of bare wood. After arrival we waited two hours to have our bathroom exhaust fan changed with a new one because it didn't work. This was for a 33rd anniversary celebration which was noted on the reservations but not one person made an effort to make it special for us. There is literally no one representing this resort located in this hotel, you have to walk over to a different hotel to talk to someone. So I give this resort an epic fail for our experience. Huge disappointment that I will not forget. Probably a great place for parents with kids but definitely not adults. We had room 2047, the other hotels are probably much better and at minimum you can get food or a drink in those. DO NOT STAY IN THE KALIA TOWER.\n","  review_date : March 22, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Simply put, the property is too big to be relaxing or convenient. It is obviously preferred by families because of its large pool and protected beach, but it is extremely crowded and chaotic. Every amenity requires a long walk, and getting off the property takes a bit of work. Whatever you choose to do, expect crowds and lines.1. Checking in is a disaster. There are seven towers, each a full hotel in its own right, and only one central check-in. The lines are always long (40-60 people) at check-in time, and often takes as much as 90 minutes or more. 2. Pool towel situation is awful. Guests get one card to trade for one cheap, small, white beach towel, that doesn't come close to covering the large lounge chairs. Every guest around the pool had indentations across their bodies because of the chair materials imprinting into their skin. The tip: When you trade your towel in for a fresh one, just lie and tell them you tossed 2-3 in the discard bin so they give you more.3. No laundry facilities. How can a place that caters to families not have a laundry facility (like the Marriott and several others do)? So they can gouge you for dry cleaning services. The nearest laundromat is a few blocks away, but that's not as close as it sounds.4. They charge extra to receive FedEx packages. The don't have a mail center, so they send it to a 3rd party business in one of the towers, which charges you to pick up the package. I've never had to pay to receive a hotel delivery in my life, in any country. Worse, they are releasing your package without your authorization to a third-party business. FedEx only tracks it to the hotel, not the outside business, so there's a higher chance for it to get lost.5. Rooms (in Rainbow tower) had terrible water pressure and took 5 minutes to get warm. The toilet didn't flush well, and the room AC ran all night (in spite of it being set to Auto). I will say the beds were comfortable, although some of the pillows stank of mildew. The maid service was very good, however.6. The onsite restaurants varied in quality, but most were expensive. There is a Starbucks in at least two of the towers, but the line at the one in the Diamond Head tower typically backed up and had a 20-30 minute wait. 7. Friday night fireworks were nice but they only lasted 3 minutes, so get there early or you'll miss it. 8. The staff was friendly, but they all seemed very tired and overburdened by the size of the place. We like our bartenders at the Paradise Lounge a lot.\n","  review_date : March 22, 2019\n","\n","[parse_reviews] url: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii-or220.html?filterLang=en\n","[get_reviews_ids] data-reviewid: ['660348215', '660246638', '660232147', '660227980', '660209970']\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : We have stayed at this hotel for 19 years...our son was 2 when we first enjoyed it.A massive resort with family touch.

The room was excellent and the view of diamond head superb. We stayed in the Rainbow Tower which was right on the beach. Overall a pleasant stay. The only criticism that I would make is that our flight from Australia landed very early in the morning. Before travelling, I received an offer of an early check in for an extra fee. I jumped at this chance as the opportunity to get straight into the room and shower was very appealing. When we arrived we were told that our room was not ready yet and we would be contacted when it was. I mentioned the offer and was told that check in time is 3:00pm and if the room was not ready by 2:00pm (I think) that I would not be charged. We went and had breakfast and a stroll and then checked on the room only to be told still not ready. I informed the concierge not to worry about the early check in as we were going for a walk and getting in at 2 is no different at this stage than waiting till 3. I was not expecting to get straight into the room until it was offered. My opinion in this is that if you cannot deliver on your offer then do not offer it. There was nothing in the original email to say it was conditional on the room being ready.\n","  review_date : March 21, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : The Alii Tower at the Hilton Village Waikiki was fabulous = great views, the best location, very helpful staff, especially \"Claire\" at the main check-in desk with her professional handling of our arrangements, \"Daniel\" in that same main lobby area was fab!, \"Taylor\" in IT was very helpful with our internet issues, \"Carissa\" in the CRAZY SHIRTS shop was delightful, and \"Alex\" at the water sports / paddle board / water bike rental hut was extremely helpful and accommodating!

To say it is large is an understatement - it is a massive property and houses normal towers of varying degrees of refurbishment, towers of timeshare properties, multiple swimming pools, a lagoon, a conference center, shopping, restaurants, beach, etc. You never actually have to leave the property, but you probably should. Why? Honolulu is full of other things to eat and see and to get the best experience you should leave the property. With that said, if you like to stay on property only, then personally I prefer Disney's Aulani instead since it feels a bit nicer, but you'll probably also be paying a premium for that. We stayed in the lagoon tower, which has great views of the ocean and beach from one side and the coast/lagoon from the other. The rooms themselves are a little dated and probably need to be updated soon, but they aren't the oldest rooms we've stayed in. They actually felt very similar to the Waikoloa Village property which is undergoing its own renovation right now.While there is more to do than at the Waikoloa Village, at least the Waikoloa Village had a train and boat to get to different areas of the property. Here you'll just have to walk, but at least you can do what everyone else does and walk past the Louis Vuitton store, straight to the multiple ABC stores on property.For some reason pools in Hawaii always seem to feel too cold to me, and the Hilton Hawaiian Village wasn't an exception. I suppose that with the temperature most of the year being warm and the sun beaming down, it would be a colossal waste of energy to heat the pools, but it just help encourage use of the beach and lagoon. Hey, you're in Hawaii, go to the beach and enjoy!With all that said, I thought our stay was ok. I'd probably opt for something more center-Waikiki if we came back, or like I said, go to Aulani again, where we could get free childcare all. day. long.

Some of the water slides were closed and they really are only for children.They have a lagoon where you can rent SUP and aqua bikes. The problem is people also swim in the lagoon making it difficult and dangerous to use the aqua bikes.The rooms in the Tapa Tower were very old looking.

To say I am a bit jaded with this property is an understatement. However, my other half had never been to Oahu and I thought an immersion into the chaos of Waikiki would explain why I like Kauai more. We arrived at the HHV valet and were promptly greeted and welcomed. We were booked into the Alii tower (info gleaned from staying here before) meaning we skipped the chaos of the main lobby and went directly to the Alii check-in. We were warmly greeted at the Alii tower check-in and recognized as AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts (FHR) guests. We were personally greeted by the concierge who escorted us to our room and went over the property and our AMEX FHR benefits. We were also given wrist bands (braided friendship bracelets) which gave us priority line access at Tropics Bar. Our room was quite nice though there were some minor dings and dents on the furnishings. We were on the tenth floor in room A1004 ocean front with a great view of the beach and Diamond Head. The bathroom was large with a separate water closet with a magic ToTo toilet complete with heated seat!! The bed was firm, and we found the pillows to be too soft. We definitely heard hallway noise especially people slamming doors. For the life of me, I will never understand why people slam their hotel room doors. Additionally, we could hear people opening and closing their balcony sliding door. The balcony was fantastic for watching the Friday night fireworks!As AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts guests we had breakfast included in our stay. Tropics Bar & Grill was our designated breakfast spot. We really enjoyed breakfasts there and our wristbands got us head of the line every morning. However, as much as we enjoyed breakfast at Tropics our attempt to have drinks around sunset were marred by an employees’ union demonstration. The noise was intolerable for enjoying a drink and conversation. The protesters complete with bullhorns and drums made so much noise that we quickly left our table before we even had a chance to order. We ended up at the Tapa Bar which turned out to be a lot of fun and we got to know Randy our bartender!We tried to utilize the Alii pool but unless you get up at the crack of dawn and “reserve” chairs then you are out of luck. There once was a large hot tub but it is now filled in with dirt and plants and been replaced with a free-standing hot tub you could buy at Home Depot. The hot tub was full of kids and the water was green. We gave up and went to the beach and just rented two beach chairs ($18 each) and umbrella ($36) for $70 total. I recommend if we must spend the money to enjoy the beach then the HHV should at least send bar servers out to us! This is one area I would recommend HHV improve. We went looking for snacks but found the Wiki Wiki Market line was out the door. We tried to get sodas, snacks and sunscreen at the Whalers General Store, but they were CLOSED during lunch time! Seriously made this an inconvenience since it is close to the beach. Who closes a store in a mega resort for lunch when that is when people want snacks etc.!?! We finally just ordered food from the pool bar, but we had to go order and wait for it at the bar.The HHV is crowded. There are lines for everything. We tried to get coffee at Starbucks but the line at both locations were ridiculous. There once was a nice bar in the main lobby which has now been replaced by a make your own flip flop merchant and the crowded main lobby has a coffee bar where once there was seating. A walk around the property is quite lovely but the throngs of people moving around means you are more likely dodging people and not really enjoying your walk. We found having a car was convenient, so we could get out and about from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.

Booked a room through Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts for a trip for me and my daughter. There was a glitch with our reservation - it should have been easily resolved had the hotel bothered to help or offer a sliver of customer service. But they chose not to. Amex tried to help - to no avail. After sitting in the lobby for an hour (after a 30 minute wait online) we left for the Outrigger Waikiki. Our experience with the Hilton Hawaiian Village was awful. The place is so big - 7 towers. It’s clear they don’t value their guests, there’s always another tour bus on the horizon. I’m thankful the Outrigger had room for us. They were awesome. We shared our story and they took really good care of us. I would never, ever go back to the Hilton Hawaiian Village.

Upon arrival to the hotel, we had to walk all the way to check in where the shuttle dropped us off which isn't too far but no help with luggage. Once we got to check in the agent was not friendly at all and did not speak with us unless she had to. She typed away and advised us of our room and sent us on our way. We came for our baby moon and anniversary and this was notes, but not even a welcome. We got to our room in the Tapa tower which was an ocean view and overall had a great view. The room itself was disappointing. It was clearly dated, dirty as dust was layered on the tables and TV stand. I called and asked if they could clean it on 3 seperate days and it never was. The washroom was okay, small but the towels were not great. The fridge was nice as it kept our beers and drinks extra cold. Bed overall was nice but it's hard trying to sleep as the doors slam so loud, not sure if it was just our area but seemed everyone slammed the doors plus the amount of light that gets into the room via the hallway was annoying. Maid service was good and was usually done whole we went to the pools and beach. The pools were nice and easy to get a spot but the pools were really cold, usually I don't complain cause I enjoy cold pools but this was way to cold. The beach was great and always could find a spot but $18 for chairs and 35 or so for an umbrella c'mon. They nickel and dime you for every thing. The resort fee alone is $50 of nothing, they claim it's worth over $120... Ahhh yea right it gets you nothing useful. The resort has tons of restaurants and ABC right in it which is the same price but the food places such as Round table, $30 for a medium, jist order dominos or other places to the room if you want pizza or walk out 5-10 minutes to a ton of places nearby. I went to the Tapa bar during happy hour, $6 beers $8 mai tais... Decent deal but plastic cups? Seriously you can't even give me a glass. As for security, anyone can use the pool, beach of course is public, but we saw families who were not staying at the reosrt using the pools and leaving and taking up space, It's pretty obvious, and no security to elevators or rooms. Would I come back? Unless i got an even better deal I would not. It's a great location but so many better options for the price. This is just a huge place\n","  review_date : March 15, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a massive complex on the edge of Waikiki that feels a bit like Las Vegas but on the beach. And yes, as indicated in many reviews, there's thousands of rooms and therefore thousands of people. But I liked it much more than I expected because I went in with the right expectations. I was able to get personal service when I asked for it but it's not constantly on offer because of the sheer size of the place. I am not sure what people are expecting out of a hotel room but our city view Family Room was extremely spacious and pleasant with a fun view of the downtown core and the mountain range behind it. I didn't miss a pool or ocean view once because we don't hang out in our room besides sleeping and showering.I had every intent on managing my parking costs but decided to valet when I arrived because I had tired of dealing with driving in the heavy Honolulu traffic. And yes, $52 a night is steep but it was so pleasant to have the valet manage the parking while I enjoyed my vacation. This splurge was so worth it from a relaxation point of view and the valet staff is super pleasant.The complex had ample pools and we tried all of them that were accessible to us. All the pools were ice cold. As-in swimming in water from an arctic spring. This may be pleasant in the summer months but it royally sucked in early March. It didn't matter to our preteens but their parents never got into the water once. The hot tubs have a limit of 9 people and do not allow for anyone under 5 years old. These rules are completely ignored and I must have counted at least 9 5 year olds in the hot tub with another 20 people. It was crazy full, quite gross and unsafe yet the staff seems powerless to stop it. There are no lifeguards anywhere so watch your kids at all times. This wasn't difficult for me because 90% of the time there was nowhere to sit anyways so I walked the perimeter of the pool to kill the time.The ocean water was warmer and enjoyable yet still brisk in the morning. The Waikiki beach is soft for about 3 feet into the water and then the bottom turns into small, and sometimes sharp, rocks. I am bringing water shoes next time but it is manageable with bare feet. Enough waves for some timid boogie boarding. The $45 resort charge does NOT include any chairs on the beach. A couple of chairs and an umbrella will run you $70 per day. It's hard to defend this charge but it does mean chairs are available for those willing to pay. We're not a family that will sit on a beach all day so we did not indulge. The lagoon was chilly as well but the kids loved snorkeling in it. You can get equipment for $6 at the ABC store in the Tapa Tower. The prices for renting water toys at the lagoon are insane but plenty of people made use of them.Drinks around the resort are expensive which you can expect at $8-15 per drink. They do have happy hour specials which I appreciated. Mixed drinks were very inconsistent in quality.The food at the restaurants was not top quality but very decent for the amount of food that they put out. Like anywhere in Waikiki, food prices are very high which you'll have to factor into your budget.The hotel's website runs specials all the time which you should wait and hunt for. The specials won't show up anywhere but on the hotel's site, not even Hilton's booking tool will pull it up unless you have the sale code. There's substantial savings to be had here!If you prepare yourself for a big resort with lots of people and understand where the extra charges show up, you too can have a great time at this resort. Make sure you leave Waikiki and see the entire island!\n","  review_date : March 15, 2019\n","\n","[parse_reviews] url: https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Hotel_Review-g60982-d87016-Reviews-Hilton_Hawaiian_Village_Waikiki_Beach_Resort-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii-or260.html?filterLang=en\n","[get_reviews_ids] data-reviewid: ['658554838', '658323750', '658314143', '658312601', '658310039']\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Lovely hotel, great setting, poor concierge service - mis-information and hard to find the right people who knew details ( on kids club for example).

Not actually rude however not particularly pleasant either. That was especially surprising. The hotel is right on the beach which is wonderful. We loved Tropics Bar & Grill. It's a huge place with everything you need right in the village so very convenient. We were also a bit surprised by the uncomfortable bed. Perhaps our expectations were too high however the bed was very hard, linen was ok but nothing particularly luxurious. Just a bit surprising. We had a king room which was very spacious and included a mini-fridge. Overall it's a great location and nice to have everything you need right in the village.

We raised our concerns with hotel management and they rectified the situation, offering new rooms and free buffet breakfasts. The pool temperature was a little above melted ice and as the weather wasn't as warm as anticipated, we preferred to swim in the lagoon instead which is amazing.The grounds are immaculate and all the staff are friendly and helpful.Food is expensive and Starbucks is at least 30% more at the 2 stores inside HHV than one outside so if you're planning on eating at the resort all the time be prepared to pay extra. The shrimp truck at the back of the lagoon is delicious.The day spa is also pricey (which is to be expected at a hotel) but very luxurious and well worth it.

The resort is so massive it can be frustrating to find where to go when you first get there. Between trying to find a place to park in the tight parking garage to dragging luggage up two different sets of elevators, we were exhausted. Once you finally get to explore the grounds, however, it becomes a lot easier to navigate. There are plenty of signs to direct you, and it's pretty difficult to get lost once you familiarize yourself with what's close by. I just wish the initial check-in was easier to navigate.

We waited 30-60 minutes to eat in every restaurant - even for breakfast - on property. I tried for Starbucks one day and even waited in long line there. Plus, I paid $17 for a latte and protein box. We learned quickly to eat away from the resort. Friday night there were fireworks on the beach and it was as if the entire island knew. The crowds were unbelievable.

So keeping your eye peeled at the Hilton Hawaiian Village site you can scoop up a bargain. Hotel is so large - seven towers - that if they lose a big group, the traveler is rewarded. But beware - all hotels in Hawaii add on a Resort Fee to their base price. I stayed on a business trip and it was ideal. Good rooms, good food, ample dining on site and off; short walk to heart of Waikiki or taxis, Uber, Lyft abound. Nearby parks but truth is you don't have to leave if you don't want to. I recommend scouting out your spot at the pools early if you have a preference for sun or shade. The resort fee comes with discounted parking a free movie, free towels, papers, two bottles of water (they should make that daily), and generally solid customer service. This year (I was also there in 2018) the check-in process was much easier. They now have online check in but even not using it, I didn't have to wait at all. Their beach is pristine and there are all types of water activities. Be warned, the property is big so there is a lot of walking.\n","  review_date : March 6, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : We came here for our baby moon and were sorely disappointed by the poorly designed layout of the resort and the freezing swimming pools.Poor design: Seems like the resort layout was designed to make you walk much farther than required. As a 7-month pregnant woman who was on my feet/walking most of the day, the last thing I wanted was todo upon returning to the resort was walk clear across the property to get to my room. Some walkways and building are placed in illogical places.Freezing swimming pools: As a pregnant traveller, I was planning to spend quite a bit of time at the pools as it helps relieve some of the pain/discomfort associated with pregnancy. I was only able to spend an hour or so in the Paradise Pool (the one with screaming children due to the water slides) because it is the ONLY HEATED POOL on property. The other, quieter pools were unbearably cold - it's no wonder there were hardly any people in them. Other than that our room was clean and a good size. We spent a lot of time on our balcony to soak in the views, good weather, and quiet. On-site restaurant food was mediocre at best, but with high prices - to be expected at a hotel resort. We likely won't return to this resort.\n","  review_date : March 6, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Love this resort.

I recommend just the general permission for the event.

We are renting two rooms so paying $80 a day for the resort fee. Two beach chairs and 1 umbrella costs $70 a day extra to rent. Otherwise, you have to lie on your Hilton teeny tiny paper thin pool towel on the sand without any shade. Oh and there are no umbrellas around the pool area either so if you burn easily or don't want direct sun at all hours of the day, you are out of luck.

Our mornings started off with a wonderful buffet breakfast in the lanai. Great food and very friendly service. The pricey luau is another story. Somehow, the roof of a parking garage doesn’t say aloha. The food was mediocre, but the excellent entertainment saved the night. Loved the hotel’s photo history wall.

Awesome artificial Lagoon with water sports.Cons: 1. Unreasonably high parking fees.

Positives: Location-easy access to everything you could possibly want and a beautiful beach and oceanscape; Beauty-lush foliage and landscaping with plenty of room for a calming walk; Housekeeping-WAY improved from last stay. Room always cleaned in the a.m. rather than 3pm or later. Negatives: The schlep w/ luggage from the depot seems endless. It's on uneven stone causing the spinner luggage to stop suddenly. TAKE A CAB, NOT ROBERTS...then you come right up to the main check-in; the rooms are looking tired and could use a facelift since they are in their \"luxury\" tower; I reserved a corner oceanfront room, which I got. However, on the 4th floor. The view was fine, but it was LOUD due to delivery trucks and tour busses backing up and parking under 1 balcony, and the Ali'i pool under the other balcony. I expected better for a return guest AND a Hilton Honors member. The shopping is fabulous, as before. The food in Tropics is ample and really good.

I had a great experience this trip as I did in 1982. Now for my 27 year updated review (there was no TripAdvisor 27 years ago).We arrived and were warmly greeted at the front desk by Howel. He was very gracious and provided us early check in as well as a wonderful view in the diamond head tower. Thank you Howel. You made our arrival fantastic.Great room, great view. The room was well furnished with all the Hilton Amenities. Carpet was clean, walls nicely painted with tasteful crown molding, coach was comfortable, bed very very comfortable (always feel at home when I travel and sleep on a Hilton bed). Ac very quiet, room very quiet, hot water comes on reasonably fast (was on the 14th floor). I also really liked the anuenue coconut papaya products.  Internet was fast (was able to hook up my Roku). Great selection of channels on cable tv. I really liked the countertops and flooring in this room as well as the tiling and height adjustable removable shower head in combo tub.The Hilton service team has the Aloha spirit. Jeaney in housekeeping kept our room spotless and well stocked with everything. As I have mentioned in many previous reviews, housekeeping can make or break a visit. It is one of the most difficult jobs in the industry. Thank you Jeaney. I also had an issue with my on line check in and Hilton Corporate Supervisor Santella fixed it fast and was very gracious. The in room hair dryer did not function properly and a new one was delivered almost immediately. I have already mentioned that Howel at the front desk went above and beyond and even offered to help us with our luggage. Please keep in mind that the Hilton Bellman will not impose upon you when you arrive (a lot of folks like to carry their own bags), so when you are greeted at the curb (which we were), ask for a Bellman. Sorry Bellmen, I should have asked.Hilton has some great restaurants and stores on site, but if you are on a budget there is an iHop across the street from the Hilton Property as well as a McDonalds. There is a bus stop also outside the property that will take you anywhere you want to go on the Island for 25 cents up to $2.50 (if you want to go all the way to the North Shore). Lyft and Uber are available for pick ups behind the Diamond Head Tower. If you do not have Lyft or Uber you can use Charley’s Taxi for flat rate service at the main lobby.During our stay, we did not find it necessary to rent a car, we were able to get everywhere via tour pick up, bus or Lyft (including ride from airport). I estimate I saved almost $600 in car rental and parking fees during my stay. You can also! Feel free to email me and I will tell you how and why.The Hilton has all sorts of things to see and do within the property, and if you like to walk, everything is within about a 1.5 mile radius (including the Ala Moana Shopping Center). This shopping center has everything for everyone including the well known high end stores. It also has a very nice Macy’s whose prices are very competitive with internet prices including Amazon. They also have a great food court, and daily entertainment. If you want to go snorkeling, you might think about Kaimana Tours, they will pick you up at an arranged location, provide you snorkel gear, and return you for a very reasonable price. They take you to Hanauma Bay, which is one of the nicer and safer snorkel spots on the Island. I am sure there are also boat tours that can take you to other nice spots. Makani Catamaran (which is within walking distance - about a mile) has some very good sailing and snorkeling deals. Compare their prices to the Hilton and see which one meets your needs.The Hilton Rainbow Village continues to evolve as do their guests, and staff. Please keep in mind that this is a very large complex, maintenance is constantly ongoing and the furniture in your room that may look a bit worn is expensive teak or other woods that can never be replaced and are very expensive to refurbish. Old is not necessarily bad, and sometimes new never has a unique story or history behind it. It is just new.Thank you Hilton Family- Howel, Jeaney, Santella, Dean and all the Hilton staff - Mahalo for making me feel at home.\n","  review_date : March 4, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : Rooms are spacious and comfortable.

The property is only a few miles from the airport , but with traffic took us 45 minutes to get there and 30 to return. The Honolulu area is VERY busy and with the commuters and visitors makes for slow traffic. We had a rental car. Valeted the first day and then self parked the rest of the week - not cheap at $45-$50 a day. The property is huge and very busy even in the off Winter season. Be prepared. There are some restaurants on site and very costly. A few other options available too, but still will cost a family of 4, not drinking, $75-100. A few non-hotel restaurants across the street and still in the $$-$$$ range. Typical for HI though, food is costly. The grounds were impeccable, well maintained, and easy to move through. Friday nights are fireworks on the beach and it gets VERY busy with lots and lots of visitiors. Be prepared. We were upgraded to a family suite (I'm a diamond member), but I heard many families getting complimentary upgrades. You should request one. Our daily services were well before 10am and were done very well. Our biggest dissapointed was the age and outdated feel of the rooms. we had stained coaches, rusted sink drains and peeling wallpaper. I do typically expect more from Hilton but with as large as the resort is, it can be possible for not every rm to be perfect. I did report to the front so they can address, if they choose to. Overall, gets a 4 out of 5 on this scale, but probably more like a 3.75.\n","  review_date : March 3, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : The Ali'i Tower is always a terrific choice. The tower has it's own check-in desk so you can avoid the long lines at general check-in, it has it's own pool and gym area so it's not as crowded and the rooms are great. When we first checked in, they gave us a room overlooking the park (Diamond Head side of building). We didn't like it as it was on a low floor and you could hear the delivery vehicles, especially very early in the morning. The staff were very accommodating in changing our room the next day and we ended up on the 15th floor overlooking the resort and with a great water view. We saw the Friday night fireworks from the lanai and got to watch a luau at a private function on the great lawn area. This was our 3rd or 4th time at HHV and we keep coming back because the resort is really well maintained and the staff are extremely helpful, happy and friendly. Whatever you ask for, they can generally accommodate. The Ali'i Tower also has it's own concierge service so you can book restaurants, cars, or activities right there. Proximity to its own beach is a bonus and it's much less crowded than Waikiki Beach. The walk into the heart of Waikiki only takes 10 or 15 minutes, so you're still close enough to all the restaurants and shops.

There are plenty of surrounding shops and places to grab coffee within walking distance of the hotel. The room itself was quite comfortable - the property is somewhat dated, but we didnt' spend much time there anyhow.

Our 6-y-o boy absolutely loved Camp Penguin. There were four different ladies who staffed the camp during the four days he attended (2/22 - 2/25), and he adored them. He wants to know why he can't quit sports at home and return to Camp Penguin each day, and he cried off and on for the next three days after we left. Thank you so much for showing him such a good time. (2) Food and beverage was good. Bali dinner and the Rainbow Lanai breakfast were over-priced even for a resort, but food was good. Round Table Pizza and Rocky Japanese were priced better and both were very good. Fish sandwich at Paradise was great. The Cadillac margarita and Category 5 Hurricane at the Taco place beside the pool were also very good. Service was very good at each restaurant. Breakfast service was a little patchier, but it's a buffet mainly, so no biggie. The onsite acai berry juice store (begins with an L) was very good, the power bowl (quinoa puffs, chia seeds, bananas, etc.) was really good. Even Starbucks service was pretty good and quick in spite of the long lines each morning. (4) Staff was friendly and hard-working. Kristin at front office, and the kind lady who checked me into the hotel when I was a disoriented mess, were both fantastic! (3) Views from the ocean-view rooms were wonderful. On the west-facing side of the Rainbow Tower, we were able to watch a fireworks show from our balcony, and were treated to a double-rainbow after a rain shower. (4) The beach is beautiful, and right beside the hotel. (5) Room was sufficiently spacious for the three of us to share for four days. We were comfy.Lows. (1) There is a restaurant beneath our room on the 4th floor in the Rainbow Tower, and the cooking odors from the vent fan (oil/frying smells) linger on the balcony and fill your room if you leave the balcony door open. A higher floor is probably better. (2) There are a lot of rocks in the beach, once you step into the water. If you have swim/water shoes, bring them! Don't try heavy Keen sandals or something - you'd drown! (3) The property is very busy. Be prepared to wait at the front desk any time of day. For checkout, we called bell service 30 minutes before we needed to leave, and they never made it to our room. Instead, my wife and I lugged the bags ourselves. (4) The \"free\" water is not a resort benefit. It is bait to get you to listen to a sales pitch for the time share. (5) Pool was not heated. My son didn't care, but a bit to chilly for wimpy old mom and dad. (6) Mattress was a bit worn, I had to sleep in the \"trough\". Comforter and sheet are sewn together, so you can't kick-off just the comforter if you get hot. (7) No children's allergy medicine at the onsite ABC store. You gotta go to CVS/Long's Drugs or Walmart (if it's after 6pm) off property - $8 Uber each way. (8) Do not watch the herons hunt when there are ducklings nearby. The herons aren't hunting the fish...it's heartbreaking!!! Other notes: (1) Keep you ID with you. Some of the restaurants and stores require it, in order to let you charge to your room. (2) No pool toys allowed. Overall good. I would happily stay here again. I might try for a high floor with ocean view in the Tapa Tower next time.

By 10:00am there were never any chairs available as there were so MANY people wanting to sit by the pool. The water was freezing cold and no-one was swimming in the pool but hanging at the edge of the pool simply getting their feet wet because it was too cold to get in. (despite the hot temperatures outside) There was not one umbrella by any of the pools. So no umbrella's, water too cold to swim in and being 85 degree's outside - well makes for a short stay at the pool. Even the Rainbow Tower pool had no-one swimming due to the cold water. An adult cannot properly visit and stay at the slide pool due to the hundreds of children. Poolside XS size drinks are $12 - $15. If your interested to stay at the ocean then you must rent a chair for $18 and an umbrella for $35. For a family of four a few hours on the beach adds up to $107. I should remind that this is over and above the $40 you pay for resort fee's everyday. I'm wondering just what those resort fee's cover since there is NO place to sit at the pools, NO umbrella's, COLD non-swimable water. I expected to spend my days at the pool or ocean and it wasn't possible for us and this was my disappointment with the hotel. The restaurants on-site were extremely expensive and overpriced for the quality of food. But then all of the restaurants in Waikiki are extremely overpriced. ($22 for a burger and fries) is standard pricing. Weather and scenery are beautiful as always and Waikiki always brings good family fun.\n","  review_date : February 28, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : The Kalia Tower was a nice find. Having stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village several times, I was at first disappointed to be in the Kalia Tower. It is older and a bit shabby. However, I did have an ocean view (sort of) and the room was clean. This tower has an upscale spa, a pool, easy access to shopping and restaurants and its own front desk and streetside entrance. Rather than crowded main desk, Kalia has its own for check-in and check-out, passenger drop-off and pick-up and easy walk to public transportation. The convenience of this tower, lower prices and the spa makes Kalia Tower preferable no one goes to Hawaii to sit in a hotel room.\n","  review_date : February 28, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : This is a huge resort, capacity-wise (not necessarily in terms of the territory. It sits next to a commercial \"village\" of sorts (the usual array of overpriced restaurants and various shops catering to tourist clientele).There's nothing special to it, I'd even call it \"faceless\" despite a stream of celebrities and dignitaries of all kinds that graced the hotel with their presence and even movies exposure - but, at the same time, there's nothing to complain about. The hotel is being well-run and well-maintained. The rooms are rather standard for resorts of this kind. The beach is right there (not the best, though - large-grain sand and quite a bit of crushed shells). In the room, we were pleasantly surprised to find a PS-3 gaming console that can run both games and DVDs you may rent from automated kiosks (free if you have a status of certain level with Hilton).The hotel has a large, well-equipped gym (I counted 33 cardio machines plus HIIT/pulley rack, all typical main-muscle groups strength machines, a full rack of dumbbells running through 100 lbs, balls, batons, etc. There's a nice spa, too. They also offer group classes in various sports.Breakfasts were ok, although I'd expect a bit higher variety of morning foods. In any case, there are options for dining within a walking distance from the hotel.All in all, a positive experience. By Hawaii standards, an excellent hotel.\n","  review_date : February 27, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : First off, kudos to all the staff here at HHV - they are doing an amazing job and deserve the world for what they do every day for their guests. I have read a few reviews about people complaining about service - I didn't experience any of that. I am a HH Diamond - sometimes I don't get any recognition for my status at all (i cannot care less as my work pays for most of my stays - and I get to hang on to my points) but this HHV blew me away with their hospitality. We were here to celebrate our anniversary and met this beautiful lady, Donna P. We chatted a bit, and then she surprised us with a ocean view room upgrade to Rainbow tower. Oh, and I booked my entire stay using points I had accumulated over the past year - so it was a free stay for me. My original booking promised a mere resort view room. Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with Donna's hospitality. She also went above and beyond to surprise us with some celebration gift from wiki wiki. We came across few other staff during our stay and each of them were pleasant. If you care about these genuinely hard working people, please support their movement so resorts pay them a living wage and no one has to work multiple jobs. Our room was spacious - with a gorgeous view. However, the sign of aging was evident. These rooms can use some spruce up. We found some insects on and around the coffee machine. I am not sure what kind of insects are these but attaching a photo in case you can identify and decide for yourselves. They have 55-inch tv and a PS3 in room. You can also enjoy DVD rental with your DVD now card (you'll receive it when you check in). Our PS3 didn't initially work - we had to call maintenance and they figured last guest decided to take the HDMI cord home with them (another reminder what hospitality industry workers have to deal with everyday).You can find colorful fish, parrots, macaws, doves, pigeons, turtles and all sort of things scattered throughout the property. The hidden gem is the 4th floor pool across from the gym (no splashing kids around). If you're Gold or Diamond - you'll also receive $10 per day per person food credit. For our 5 day stay between two of us, it was a neat $100 to spent. You can use that credit all at once or in increments (don't have to use everyday) - which was great. The weekly fireworks are amazing too. Beach equipment rental are a bit pricey, food quality varies so much among restaurants - it's hard to believe they are run by the same management. Rainbow tower elevator had all their switches outside - remember to press your floor first before entering. All in all, this was a great stay and we are very grateful for the hospitality extended to us. We will be back, hopefully in the next couple of years. Tip: Ask for ocean view room. This property is huge (3390 rooms) with multiple ~30 story towers. If you're stuck in a terrace view - you'll be missing out on the breath-taking ocean view.\n","  review_date : February 27, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : I love hilton, but for this hotel, I really cannot recommend for anyone.

We booked a partial ocean view room. Internet was choppy and hard to connect to but we were out most of the time so it didn’t bother us either. We had such a great time we decided we would have to come back someday, we just didn’t expect to come back again in Dec 2018. Back for the second time, we booked an ocean view room this time in the rainbow tower. At check in we got upgraded to the rainbow tower room with the double balconies. I’ve never seen a more beautiful view! We pretty much spent our week inside the hotel enjoying the view. Internet was definitely better this time around. The rooms are still old but it’s understandable. The elevators can get busy at times and you’d have to wait because they would be so packed. We were able to view the fireworks from our balcony. My fiancé got sick from eating somewhere on the hotel grounds, couldn’t pinpoint what it was but we still enjoyed ourselves, at least we had the gorgeous view. I have to give praise to our housekeeper who made an effort every morning to say good morning to us and asked us everyday how her service was and if there was anything we needed. That was nice of her as I felt like she was paying attention to us. The day we checked out, she said she hopes we will be back, and I certainly do hope I can come back for a third time! \n","  review_date : February 24, 2019\n","\n","--- review ---\n","\n","  review_body : We were so excited to check off a bucket list vacation for my husband's 50th birthday.

This property is in major need of an update, but all they want yo do is try to sell you one of their new suites in the new timeshare tower. Stayed in the Ali'i tower which h us the most expensive and boasts many benefits. Our refrigerator froze all if our good and beverages....we had a soda explode all over the room when we opened it. All they did for ys was defrost the fridge. Our bathtub clogged up twice, disgusting. We only had a down comforter with a duvet cover. No top sheet or blanket??? Our carpet was FILTHY, our dresser was literally falling apart and was nearly unusable as it didn't stay in the tracks. Our \"private\" pool used to have a large hot tub that is now filled with potted plants, there is a residential hot tub to compensate, really???? Invest in your current property before building new towers. This resort caters heavily to the Japanese visitors. I would guess they were 80% of the guests. Our staff at our check-in lobby never acknowledged us after we cheiin, we were there for 10 days. The pools in the \"village\" incredible insufficient for the amount of guests staying there....and they've built a new tower??? The hotel us dirty and not taken care of.
